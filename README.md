## Introduction
This repo consist of two modules.

1. Miniature version of map using simple arrays
2. Heap and process memory allocation using linked list ( the memory allocated for this is 
not allocated in the own heap but rather in a small chunk of memory at end the of the disk space)

> Syntaxes are limited to our own language and not C++ or C

## Map
The map is a miniature version using simple arrays. This supports the following functions

1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Search
4. Display

## Heap
The heap and process memory allocation is done using linked list. The memory allocated for this is
not allocated in the own heap but rather in a small chunk of memory at end the of the disk space.

The free heap supports the following functions

1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Find
4. Allocate
5. Deallocate

The process memory allocation supports the following functions

1. Insert
2. Delete (deallocate is also done here)
3. Find
4. Allocate
